This is an early version of the document. I am a beginner in Svelte, let alone SvelteKit. But I don't want that to stop me from sharing what I know to people just starting out. Some people starting out relate more to beginners than experienced developers because they've forgotten what it's like just starting out. As I continue to use Svelte or Svelte Kit I will update this page.

SvelteKit is used to create websites. If you know about React, Vue or Angular then the closest to them is Svelte. SvelteKit uses Svelte with a few more additions. I highly recommend first learning Svelte. A lot of this guide will be about Svelte.
Out of all the front-end libraries Svelte caught my interest the most because of how easy it looked to start. In single file you can have your styling, script and page structure. It's written in a way to make it really comfortable to use. But don't let that push you into going too deep early on and creating complex pages. Go at it at a slow pace and have a good understanding on how everything works. The biggest waste of time for me has been when I just wing it ignoring the documentation hoping I will somehow figure it out. 

As a start for Svelte I used this crash course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TVy6GdtNuQ to get a vague understanding and started making small projects. But as my ideas got more complex and I had a lot of questions I went through this course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGBJHYpHPvA for more advance topics. Another place I used a lot during development is their website https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte They have amazing tutorials.

Only reason I moved to SvelteKit is because of routing. I needed to use the website url for different pages so that on refresh I don't lose where I am at in the dynamic website. And SvelteKit offers that. It's routing is baked in how you structure your folders.
